# How to use
Make sure that the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) is installed on your machine.

Then run from this directory:
```
julia demonstrator-multi-period.jl
```

The script creates a header file 
```
../sender-receiver-teensy/pendulum_receiver1/KalmanAndMLQRParameters.h
```
with the parameters for the Kalman filter and the mLQR controller.
